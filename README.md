# Chess Engine

This is a python-based chess engine. Currently it is only text-based, and runs a minimax algorithm to depth `difficulty`.
Installation requires the python-chess module, which can be installed as
>pip install python-chess

and the pywebview module, as
>pip install pywebview

To run an interactive game with the engine, use 
>python game.py -d [difficulty] -g

There is more to come! I will be implementing some of the practices outlined <a href=http://www.frayn.net/beowulf/theory.html#transposition>here</a>.
